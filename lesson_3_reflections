When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   For example if I have to work from another computer or if I'm working with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If I'm working on some changes but I don't want to make them public yet because they are not ready

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
A fork is a clone of a repository from a github account to another github account.
A clone is a clone of a repository from a github account to a remote or from a remote to a remote.
A branch is a series of commits in timestamp order.
I would use a fork when I want to work on a repository that comes from onother account on github.
I would use a clone when i want to be able to work on a Github repository from my local machine.
I would use a branch to make experimental changes on a project or to collaborate on a project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    We can keep developing our local branch indepentently from the remote , than we can use fetch to open another branch, starting in that known point of the branch, with all the new changes made on the remote. So now we can compare our local changes with the ones on the remote with git log and git diff.
